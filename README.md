#CollaboRead
An iPad application intended to promote student engagement in radiology lectures

##Why Use CollaboRead
Along with the web application (link to repo here), lecturers may put together radiological images and information about symptoms into cases to present to students. Our application provides an interface for lecturers to display the images to the class and tools for them to make annotations on the images. Students may follow along using the app on their own iPads to analyze the images. Lectures may also have as many students in the course as they wish submit their annotations for an image individually or in groups. These answers may be displayed on the lecturer's iPad anonymously or otherwise. This process allows more students to get involved in analyzing presented images than simply calling on a student to describe a projected image and lecturers to gather more information about the level of understanding of the class as a whole.
